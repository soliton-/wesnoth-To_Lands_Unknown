#define TLU_WARNING2
    _"- This campaign is quite different from normal Wesnoth, so don't expect other campaigns to be anything like this.
- The campaign is set in a different universe from the mainline Battle for Wesnoth one, they aren't meant to be related.
- In order to simulate height, some (or even most, in some scenarios) hexes are either unwalkable or impassable (unwalkable meaning that only flying units can move there, impassable meaning that the hex is simply off limits. Just a reminder for new players)
- Halos, unit animations, etc. are used extremely often here. You'd miss a large part of TLU-unique experience with those disabled."#enddef

Unrestrained by imagination, this entity is the most powerful being we know to this day. He was godlike, able to bend the laws of nature at a whim, but preferring to observe things the way they are.

He understood our language, and turned out to be obedient, like all magical entities summoned afterwards. We still don't know why exactly he decided to obey us, but we're certainly glad he did."

Shortly thereafter, the towers al-Kamija rose from the sands.

A few centuries have passed since those days. Nomolas rests in the central palace, wanting not to interfere with our lives. We try to only awaken him if there really is no other choice. The power of magical entities summoned after Nomolas paled in comparison to him, but their power is still not to be underestimated, and is fully sufficient for our needs."

However, in the last few years, our great minds came up with a design for a special magic circle that should be able to take us to that fantastic world. Our tests were an astounding success, but to this day we cannot summon previously sent items back to our world. As a result of this, though it may sound crazy, we decided to send the entirety of our land into the Abyss, hoping that we will find the solution on the other side. But even if we find it, we may not be able to use it...

Such a nice gesture seemed adequate, if not the only chance of survival for the people in the old native country.

According to what Anthi said, the only way to get into the Abyss was to set out to the west, to find the mysterious people who were known for accomplishing astounding feats of magic."
